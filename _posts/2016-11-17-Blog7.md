    <td>First off I went on different websites testing out all their colour scheme offers, but none of them appealed to me on the website so I went with a grey and blue mix which looks nice in some parts but not all.</td>

    <td>I need to work on moving colours around; When I set the colours and they don't look nice I can’t just leave those colours out I can edit which colour I set on which area of the blog page.</td>
